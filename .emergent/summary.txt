<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to create a pixel-perfect clone of the Open edX LMS platform. This evolved into building a sophisticated, AI-powered learning platform named ActionEDx.

The project was executed in several phases based on user feedback and a detailed architecture document:
1.  **Open edX Clone**: Build a frontend replica of .
2.  **Actionuity edX Rebrand**: Rebrand the clone to Actionuity edX with a unique identity.
3.  **AI Backend Implementation (Initial)**: Build a multi-service AI backend based on an architecture document.
4.  **Rebrand to ActionEDx**: Final rebrand of the platform to ActionEDx.
5.  **Enhanced Monolith (Phase 1)**: Refactor the backend into a microservices-ready structure, adding a WebSocket-based real-time assistant, Redis caching, and Prometheus monitoring.
6.  **Production Hardening (Phase 2)**: Add production-grade features like Rate Limiting, Circuit Breakers, advanced streaming capabilities, and Grafana dashboards.
7.  **Learning-Focused Features (Phase 3)**: Implement an advanced Learning Analytics Engine and a graph-based Adaptive Learning Path generator.
8.  **Deployment & Production Readiness (Phase 4)**: Create all necessary deployment configurations, security hardening, load testing scripts, health checks, and CI/CD pipelines.

The user's final message was , indicating that despite the extensive backend development, the frontend is not interactive.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application, ActionEDx, with a React frontend and a highly advanced FastAPI backend.
-   **Frontend**: A React application styled with Tailwind CSS. It reflects the ActionEDx branding but is **entirely non-functional**, sourcing all its data from a mock file (). The frontend service is running.
-   **Backend**: A sophisticated, production-ready enhanced monolith. It includes a multi-model AI orchestrator, WebSocket real-time assistant, Redis caching (gracefully handles Redis being unavailable), Prometheus metrics, rate limiting, circuit breakers, an advanced analytics engine, and an adaptive learning path generator. All backend services and endpoints have been tested via  and a custom test script, and are fully functional.
-   **Infrastructure**: The project is fully containerized with . It includes configurations for monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana), a CI/CD pipeline template for GitHub Actions, and various operational scripts (health checks, backups, load testing).

**Last working item**:
The agent was investigating the user's report of no link funcionality. The agent discovered the frontend service was stopped, restarted it, and verified that both frontend and backend services were running and accessible via . However, the root cause of the user's issue was not addressed.

-   **Last item agent was working**: Investigating and fixing the user's report that the application has no link funcionality.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: Y (Agent confirmed services are running via backend                          RUNNING   pid 29, uptime 0:00:07

-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Frontend testing agent. After connecting the frontend to the backend, a full end-to-end test will be required to validate the application's functionality.
-   **User Testing Done**: N (User reported the initial problem.)

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1**: Frontend is not integrated with the backend APIs. (Priority: P0)
-   **Issue 2**: Minor frontend lint errors. (Priority: P2)

**Issues Detail**:
-   **Issue 1: Frontend is not integrated with the backend APIs.**
    -   **Attempted fixes**: None. The agent only verified that the services were running but did not investigate the frontend code or its data sources.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Identify all components in  that use .
        2.  For each component, replace the mock data import with an API call ( or ) to the corresponding backend endpoint.
        3.  Use the  environment variable for all API calls.
        4.  Update component state management to handle asynchronous data loading (e.g., loading, error, and success states).
        5.  Refer to  for the list of available endpoints and their signatures.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is the most critical issue. Fixing it will make the application functional for the first time, allowing the user to interact with the powerful AI backend that has been developed.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: both

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-    has become extremely large and complex. It should be broken down into multiple FastAPI routers (e.g., , ) to improve maintainability, as originally suggested in the first handoff.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Real-time AI assistant WebSocket connection.
-   : View Redis cache statistics.
-   : View active WebSocket connections.
-   : Exposes Prometheus metrics.
-   : View status of all circuit breakers.

-   (All previous endpoints like , , etc., are still active).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **The absolute highest priority (P0) is to connect the frontend to the backend.** The user's last message, no link funcionality, is a direct result of the frontend using mock data. The entire backend, built over four phases, is inaccessible to the user.
-   The backend is designed to work even if Redis is not available; it will simply run without caching.
